## Work

### Ethereum Joy
You can find this website at [https://ethereumjoy.netlify.app](https://ethereumjoy.netlify.app) and also on my [github](https://github.com/chouweihan/Ethereum-Joy)
This is a personal website I built out of React and MaterialUI. It uses multiple different apis, including moralis, coinbase, etherscans.

This website was built to connect with metamask extension to display a variety of different information about your ethereum wallet. Including your transactions, gas information and NFTS.

The website can switch between light theme and dark theme. Funciontality to send eth to my wallet through metamask. Search, filtering and sorting of data. Audio player that you can seek, pause and play a song. 

### Max Merge Solutions
[https://maxmergesolutions.ca/](https://maxmergesolutions.ca/)

This is a web app which I contributed to at work. I built the functionality on the backend to merge, compress and split PDFs in .NET
I did it using libraries like PDFsharp and ghostscript software
Also implemented validation features for sign-in form
I worked on a few of the front-end pages/components, including the file-upload functionality. 

### Synic Creative Marketing
[https://syniccreative.marketing/](https://syniccreative.marketing/)

This is a website I built at work for the marketing team of Synic Software. I made this site myself. I have implemented different features such as google analytics, forms, video-background, integrated CMS hubspot and hubspot chatbot. 

Admin portal where the marketing team can view the forms for new leads and post new blogs via rich text editor.

## Inspiration

### 1 BlockChain
The reason I created Ethereum Joy was because of these 3 websites [paperhands](https://www.paperhands.gg/), [fees.wtf](fees.wtf), [nftnerds](https://nftnerds.ai/).
When I first came across these sites, I thought it was really cool to see all the fun information about my wallet, so I wanted to make a site that shows some niche information as well. This is also a learning process, as this is my first project relating to blockchain. These 3 sites directly interact with the blockchain, and I have yet to get to that part. Which is my next learning objective.

### 2 Animations
One thing I'll like to eventually do one day is to make the insane animations that enterprise websites does.
Here are a few examples [apple ipad](https://www.apple.com/ca/ipad-air/) and [samsung tablet](https://www.samsung.com/ca/tablets/galaxy-tab-s/galaxy-tab-s8-ultra-wifi-graphite-128gb-sm-x900nzaaxac/)

I'd like to put animations like these on my personal portfolio site one day.


## Focus
If critical mass has a team which focuses on metaverse, NFT or blockchain related code, that would be what I would want to do. 
I'm currently learning about solidity and how to write smart contracts, and I think it'll be really cool to apply it in a real project. 

The other thing I'd like to do is learn how to make the animations that apple does. 

Something else I came across recently is threeJS [heres an example](https://codepen.io/Yakudoo/pen/YGxYej). I think its pretty crazy they can create such a game with barely any lines of code. If there's something like this at Critical Mass, I would definetly be interested too.


## Coding Challenge
my fork can be found at:
[codesandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/wei-han-2022-internship-exercise-menu-forked-013wj0)

I've had some problems with using codesandbox. Seems like it has problems when saving and loading.
